- 👋 Hi, I’m @fnord235
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, Python, Bash-Scripting and ..cats :D Also I'm a big fan of Ansible. 🐈
- I'm no developer, but a network admin nowadays, after having been a sys admin at a small MSP for several years 
- Computer literally always interested me. I was lucky that we had one at home as long as I can think. 
- In my free time, I like to take strolls outside 🌞, cooking, playing computer games 🎮 and I like listening to audiobooks and podcasts 🎧, from which most are also kinda IT-related 👩‍💻. And ofc spending time with my better half <3
